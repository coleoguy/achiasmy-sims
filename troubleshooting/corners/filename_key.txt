In this folder I have stored the frequency of fusions after running simulations with different combinations of meiotic type, fusion type, mutation rate, and selection coefficient.
Goal: Ensure simulations show expected behaviors at each combination of high and low mu and s
 
All simulations share the following parameters:

number of simulations = 10
population size = 1000
number of generations = 1000

Files are named based on the unique combination of parameters:

Type of meiosis:
C = Chiasmatic
A = Achiasmatic

Type of fusions:
Y = Fusions can only occur between Y-chromosome and below-specified autosome
X = Fusions can only occur between X-chromosome and below-specified autosome

S = Fusions can only occur between above-specified sex chromosome and small autosome
L = Fusions can only occur between above-specified sex chromosome and large autosome

Folder Contents:
/06-23-2022 Plots of the frequency of fusions after running each possible combination of meiotic 
		and fusion parameters with high mu + low s and low s + high mu. Found that fusions
		of large-sex fixed sooner than fusions of small-sex. Troubleshooted this error and
		found a bug which made it such that mutations could ONLY be introduced to locus 1
		of sex chromosome.

/06-27-2022 Fixed the bug where mutations could ONLY be introduced to locus 1 of sex chromosome 
		and reran with each possible combination of meiotic and fusion parameters with high 
		mu + low s and low s + high mu.


Extreme
Hmu = high mutation rate = 10^-6
Lmu = low mutation rate = 10^-14

Hs = high selection coefficient = 0.3
Ls = low selection coefficient = 0.0001

The results of these  simulations are plotted in freq_by_gen_plots.R
