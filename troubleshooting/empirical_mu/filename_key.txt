In this folder I have stored the frequency of fusions after running simulations with a mutation
rate derived from Drosophila literature (Schrider et al. 2013, Keightley et al. 2014) with
NO sexual selection.

Goal: Ensure simulations with different sets of parameters show expected behavior when using an
empirical mutation rate.
 
All simulations share the following parameters:

number of simulations = 10
population size = 1000
number of generations = 1000
s = 0

Files are named based on the unique combination of parameters:

Type of meiosis:
C = Chiasmatic
A = Achiasmatic

Type of fusions:
Y = Fusions can only occur between Y-chromosome and below-specified autosome
X = Fusions can only occur between X-chromosome and below-specified autosome

S = Fusions can only occur between above-specified sex chromosome and small autosome
L = Fusions can only occur between above-specified sex chromosome and large autosome

mu:
5e-9 (give or take 1 order of magnitude)

The results of these  simulations are plotted in freq_by_gen_plots.R
